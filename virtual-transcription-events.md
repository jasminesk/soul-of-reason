# Virtual Transcription Events, July 2020

**Join us for a series of virtual transcribe-a-thons**, in which participants can volunteer to **hand-correct auto-generated transcriptions** of audio recordings from the *Soul of Reason* in NYU Special Collections.

During each virtual transcribe-a-thon, project team members will be available via Zoom to troubleshoot and answer questions about the recordings and the transcription process. At the end of the transcribe-a-thon events, we hope to have at least 30 recordings transcribed and made more accessible for all researchers, while connecting people deeply with these valuable primary sources.


__Session I.__    Wednesday, July 22, 2:00 - 4:00 PM (EST)  
__Session II.__   Thursday, July 23, 2:00 - 4:00 PM (EST)  
__Session III.__  Friday, July 23, 2:00 - 4:00 PM (EST)  
__Session IV.__   Saturday, July 24, 2:00 - 4:00 PM (EST)
